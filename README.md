# Box3D for Godot

**[Box3D](https://github.com/erincatto/box3d)**, Erin Catto's 3D rigid-body
physics engine, embedded in **[Godot 4](https://godotengine.org)** as a
GDExtension: drop in a `Box3DWorld`, add `Box3DBody` nodes, and simulate.

This is a fork of **[erincatto/box3d](https://github.com/erincatto/box3d)**. The
upstream engine sources are unchanged; everything Godot-specific lives in
**[`godot/`](godot/)**. The original Box3D README is preserved [below](#box3d).

> **Early and experimental.** Box3D itself is v0.1.0 and this binding is young:
> expect rough edges and API churn. It is a starting point to build on, not a
> production dependency.

## Features

- **Near-complete API parity with upstream Box3D** across 21 documented
  classes: worlds; static/kinematic/dynamic bodies;
  box/sphere/capsule/cylinder/cone/convex-hull/triangle-mesh/height-field
  colliders; nine joints (hinge, slider, distance, ball, fixed, motor, wheel,
  parallel, filter); contact and sensor events; ray/shape/overlap queries; a
  character controller with spring suspension; continuous collision; recording
  and replay; and live solver tuning. The gaps are deliberate and documented:
  upstream's external task-system hooks stay unbound for thread-safety, and
  the raw solver callbacks ship as the `Box3DContactRules` data table instead
  of script callbacks.
- **Feels native in the editor.** Every class carries in-editor documentation
  (F1 answers for the binding the way it does for a built-in node), and
  colliders and joints draw editor gizmos: a hinge shows its axis and limit
  arc before you ever press play.
- **One zip to install.** Every
  [release](https://github.com/Stink-O/box3d-godot/releases) ships one
  `addons/box3d/` zip with prebuilt libraries for Windows, Linux, Android and
  web; unzip it next to your `project.godot` and restart Godot. A second zip
  is the whole demo project, ready to open in Godot. Building it yourself is
  one `scons` command, no prebuilt engine binary required.
- **A 70-sample browser demo**: stacks, a ragdoll, a drivable car, joints,
  queries, determinism showcases and toys, organised by category, with a
  physics-engine selector that reruns any sample on Godot Physics or Jolt for
  side-by-side comparison.
- **Runs on Android** (arm64 + x86_64), verified on real hardware under
  Vulkan, with touch controls and a mobile-scaled UI. Toolchain walkthrough:
  [`godot/ANDROID_BUILD.md`](godot/ANDROID_BUILD.md).

## New in 0.4.3

- **One-zip install.** The release is now a single `addons/box3d/` zip with
  every platform's library inside, the way godot-jolt and Terrain3D ship.
  Unzip next to `project.godot`, restart Godot, done. The loose per-platform
  files are gone; Godot exports only the library that matches your target, so
  the extra platforms in the zip cost your game nothing.
- **Wind Drop sample**: a thin plate gliding down through still air, the
  upstream "Wind Drop" sample. There is no drag setting in Box3D; the
  float-down is `apply_wind` computing projected-area drag and lift against
  the plate's own velocity. Toggle the air off and it drops like a stone.
- **`max_spring_torque`** on `Box3DBallJoint` and `Box3DHingeJoint`: a torque
  ceiling on the pose spring, so a joint can be stiff without winning at any
  cost. Implemented entirely in the extension, no upstream patch.
- **`Box3DBody.set_target_transform`**: upstream's velocity-based kinematic
  drive, for moving a kinematic body to a pose in one step without teleporting.
- **Web demo no longer freezes on Wave Pile.** The 8-worker replay joined
  threads the browser had not started yet; the export's thread pool is larger
  and the sample yields before it closes a replay.
- Upstream synced through Box3D's broad-phase rewrite (three upstream
  commits: clockwise mesh winding, `b3Joint_IsAwake`, fixes, faster
  broad-phase).

## New in 0.4.2

- **Record and replay any sample, with a timeline.** Two buttons in the demo
  sidebar capture a whole session, including everything you do to it (fired
  balls, bombs, grab-drags). A draggable timeline scrubs the result in both
  directions, plays it backwards, and single-steps either way. The timeline is
  very early and still needs iteration: expect rough edges in its UI and
  behaviour, and expect it to change between releases. Reverse
  playback reads cached transforms instead of re-simulating, so scrubbing a
  16,000-body pyramid collapse costs milliseconds a frame; recordings larger
  than the memory budget spill to a temp file and stay scrubbable end to end.
- **Replays look like the scene you recorded.** A small sidecar file captures
  each body's colour and material response at record time (the `.b3rec`
  recording itself stays byte-identical to upstream's format); replaying a
  recording made at one worker count on another is a live cross-thread
  determinism check, verified on desktop at 1, 2, 4 and 8 workers.
- **In-editor gizmos** for every collider type and all nine joints, drawn in
  upstream's own debug palette so the editor and the runtime overlay agree.
- **Debug shells for every collider** in the demo's debug view: convex hulls,
  height fields and fitted meshes included, not just primitives.
- **Bombs work everywhere**: the demo's blast now auto-calibrates to scenes
  authored at upstream's density, and a crash on exploding near dynamic
  triangle-mesh bodies is guarded (the underlying upstream bug is written
  up, with the fix located, ready to file).
- Smaller: the sample picker groups by category and highlights where you are;
  saving a recording is instant and threaded with a visible progress state;
  spacebar drives the replay transport.

## Try it in a browser first

**[Play it on itch.io](https://stinkysunstep.itch.io/box3d-godot)**: the demo
in a browser, no download, multi-threaded solver, full-size scenes. Desktop,
Android and iOS all run that threaded build there. The same build is
downloadable from [Releases](https://github.com/Stink-O/box3d-godot/releases)
as `box3d-demo-web-threaded.zip` if you want to host your own; it needs a host
that sends cross-origin isolation headers (COOP/COEP), which plain static
hosting does not. To run the same demo natively, `0-box3d-demo-project.zip` on
the same release is the whole project ready to open in Godot.

**It is a preview, not the real thing.** Running the demo in Godot is the
intended way and the only one that shows the binding at full speed. The browser
build is slower on purpose and by circumstance: WebAssembly costs something over
native, and it renders through the Compatibility (WebGL2) renderer because
Godot 4.7 has no WebGPU. Judge performance from a desktop run, not from the
page. Determinism on wasm is unverified, so the browser build is not a
reference for behaviour.

## Getting started

Never used a GDExtension before? This walks the whole way, from nothing
installed to a crate falling onto a floor. **You do not need a compiler.** The
extension is a small prebuilt library that you download and drop into a folder.
Building it yourself is optional and covered in
[Building](godot/README.md#building).

> [!TIP]
> **Just want to run the demo?** Install [Godot 4.7](https://godotengine.org/download),
> download `0-box3d-demo-project.zip` from the
> [latest release](https://github.com/Stink-O/box3d-godot/releases/latest),
> unzip it, then open `box3d-demo/project.godot` in Godot (or press **Scan** in the
> project manager and point it at the unzipped folder) and press play. That zip
> is the whole demo with the extension already inside, so steps 2 to 4 below
> are only for people who want the repository too.

The short version with the repository: install Godot 4.7, get this
repository, download the addon zip from
[Releases](https://github.com/Stink-O/box3d-godot/releases) and unzip it into
`godot/demo/`, open `godot/demo/project.godot`, press play. The long version:

<details>
<summary><b>Step 1: install Godot 4.7</b></summary>

Download it from [godotengine.org/download](https://godotengine.org/download).
Godot is a single executable with no installer: unzip it and run it. The normal
(non-.NET) download is the simplest choice.

**The version matters.** This extension declares a minimum of Godot 4.7, so
4.6 and earlier will refuse to load it. If in doubt, check `Help > About` in
the editor.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Step 2: get this repository</b></summary>

Either clone it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Stink-O/box3d-godot
```

or, if you do not use git, open the
[repository page](https://github.com/Stink-O/box3d-godot), click the green
**Code** button and choose **Download ZIP**, then unzip it somewhere.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Step 3: download the addon zip</b></summary>

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Stink-O/box3d-godot/releases), open the
newest one and look under **Assets**. Download
`box3d-addon-v<version>.zip`. That one file holds the library for every
platform: Windows, Linux, Android and web. There is nothing to pick.

macOS is not prebuilt. Play the
[browser demo](https://stinkysunstep.itch.io/box3d-godot), or
[build from source](godot/README.md#building).

Windows note: the DLLs are cross-compiled from Linux and have never been run on
Windows by the author. They may work fine, but they are untested. If Windows
SmartScreen or your antivirus flags a downloaded DLL, that is the usual
unsigned-binary warning rather than a sign of a problem.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Step 4: unzip it into the demo</b></summary>

Unzip the file into this folder inside the repository:

```
box3d-godot/godot/demo/
```

so that the result is `godot/demo/addons/box3d/`. That folder already exists
in the repository with the manifest (`box3d.gdextension`) and the icons; the
zip adds the `bin/` folder with the libraries. Do not rename anything: the
manifest names each library character for character.

When you are done the folder looks like this:

```
godot/demo/addons/box3d/
  box3d.gdextension
  LICENSE
  README.md
  bin/
    libbox3d_godot.linux.template_debug.x86_64.so
    libbox3d_godot.linux.template_release.x86_64.so
    libbox3d_godot.windows.template_debug.x86_64.dll
    ...
  icons/
```

**Why two files per platform?** The `template_debug` one is what the Godot
editor itself loads, so it is the one you need to press play. The
`template_release` one is used when you export a finished game.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Steps 5 and 6: open the project and press play</b></summary>

Start Godot. On the Project Manager screen click **Import**, browse to
`box3d-godot/godot/demo/project.godot`, and open it. Godot will import the
assets once, which takes a moment the first time.

Hit **F5** (or the play button, top right). The demo opens on its first sample.
The **Samples** button in the top bar drops down the full list, grouped by
category and marking the sample you are on.
</details>

The controls worth knowing straight away:

- **Left-click and drag** grabs a body at the exact point you clicked and lets
  you throw it. While holding one, the **scroll wheel** reels it closer or
  pushes it further away.
- **Hold right mouse** to fly the camera with **W A S D**, plus **Q** and **E**
  for down and up, and **Shift** to move faster.
- **Hold F** to charge a shot and release to fire a ball from the camera. The
  longer you hold, the harder it goes. The **Shot** selector in the top bar
  swaps the ball for a fused bomb or a ragdoll.
- The **Settings** button opens a panel on the right: solver tuning, debug
  draw, the recorder, and an engine selector that reruns the same sample on
  **Godot Physics** or **Jolt**, which is the quickest way to see what the
  binding is actually doing.

## Add Box3D to your own project

Once the demo runs, using the extension in a project of your own is three
steps.

**1. Unzip the addon zip next to your `project.godot`**, so that your project
contains `addons/box3d/`. (Or copy `godot/demo/addons/box3d/` from the
repository, which is the same folder.) The manifest's paths are relative to
`res://addons/box3d/`, so the folder must keep that name and nothing needs
editing.

**2. Restart Godot.** Extensions are loaded at startup, so a project that was
already open will not see a newly added one until you close and reopen it.

**3. Check that it worked.** Add a new node and type `Box3DWorld` into the
search box. If it appears, the extension is loaded. If it does not, see the
troubleshooting table below.

Now make something fall. Create a `Node3D`, attach this script, and press play:

```gdscript
extends Node3D

func _ready() -> void:
    # Everything physical has to live under a Box3DWorld.
    var world := Box3DWorld.new()
    add_child(world)

    var ground := Box3DBody.new()
    ground.body_type = Box3DBody.STATIC   # static bodies never move
    ground.box_size = Vector3(20, 1, 20)
    ground.position = Vector3(0, -0.5, 0)
    ground.auto_visual = true             # give it a mesh so you can see it
    world.add_child(ground)

    var crate := Box3DBody.new()          # dynamic is the default
    crate.position = Vector3(0, 5, 0)
    crate.auto_visual = true
    world.add_child(crate)
```

You will need a `Camera3D` pointed at the origin to see it, and a light such as
a `DirectionalLight3D` so the shapes are not flat black. `auto_visual` is a
convenience that generates a mesh matching the collider, which is handy while
learning; for real work you add your own `MeshInstance3D` children.

From here, [`godot/README.md`](godot/README.md) documents every node, property
and joint.

## If something goes wrong

| What you see | What it usually means |
| --- | --- |
| `Box3DWorld` is not in the node list | The addon is missing, in the wrong folder, or renamed. The folder must be `addons/box3d/` next to `project.godot`, with `box3d.gdextension` and `bin/` inside it. Restart Godot after adding it. |
| An error about the extension needing a newer version | You are on Godot 4.6 or earlier. Install 4.7. |
| It works in the editor but the exported game crashes on start | The `template_release` library is missing. Export uses that one, the editor uses `template_debug`. |
| Godot loads but every sample is empty | The project was opened before the library was added. Close the project and reopen it. |
| Nothing at all happens on macOS | There is no prebuilt macOS library. Build from source or use the browser demo. |
| A downloaded `.dll` is flagged by antivirus | Expected for unsigned binaries. These particular DLLs are also untested on Windows. |

### Samples

- Uses sokol to run with D3D11 on Windows, Metal on macOS, and OpenGL 4.5 on Linux.
- Graphical user interface with imgui.
- Many samples to demonstrate features and performance.

## Building all platforms

- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Ensure these run from the command line

## Building with CMake presets (recommended)

This uses the presets in `CMakePresets.json`.

- Windows: `cmake --preset windows` then `cmake --build --preset windows-release`
- Linux: `cmake --preset linux-release` then `cmake --build --preset linux-release`
- macOS: `cmake --preset macos` then `cmake --build --preset macos-release`
- Windows MinGW: `cmake --preset mingw-release` then `cmake --build --preset mingw-release`

Run the samples app (must be in the Box3D directory).

- Windows: `.\build\bin\Release\samples.exe`
- Linux: `./build/bin/samples`
- macOS: `./build/bin/Release/samples`

## Building for Visual Studio

- Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- Run `build_vs2026.bat`
- Open and build `build/box3d.slnx`

## Building for Linux

- Run `build.sh` from a bash shell
- Results are in the build sub-folder

## Building for Xcode

- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake -G Xcode ..
- Open `box3d.xcodeproj`
- Select the samples scheme
- Build and run the samples

## Building for Web

- [Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)
- `emcmake cmake -B build -DBOX3D_SAMPLES=OFF`
- `cmake --build build`

Box3D uses SSE2 with WebAssembly. Define `BOX3D_DISABLE_SIMD` to disable SSE2.

## Building and installing

- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..
- cmake --build . --config Release
- cmake --install . (might need sudo)

## Using Box3D in your project

The core library has no dependencies beyond the C runtime (and `libm` on Unix). Linking it
gives you the `box3d::box3d` target.

I recommend to use FetchContent:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(box3d
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/erincatto/box3d.git
  GIT_TAG v0.1.0)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(box3d)

target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE box3d::box3d)
```

For a vendored copy or git submodule, point `add_subdirectory` at it:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(extern/box3d)

target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE box3d::box3d)
```

To use a copy installed with `cmake --install`, find the package:

```cmake
find_package(box3d 0.1 REQUIRED)

target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE box3d::box3d)
```

See [`docs/hello.md`](docs/hello.md) for a minimal first program.

## Compatibility

The Box3D library and samples build and run on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

You will need a compiler that supports C17 to build the Box3D library.

You will need a compiler that supports C++20 to build the samples.

Box3D uses SSE2 and Neon SIMD math to improve performance. SIMD can be disabled by defining `BOX3D_DISABLE_SIMD`.

## Documentation

The user manual lives in [`docs/`](docs/) and is built with Doxygen. Enable the `BOX3D_DOCS` CMake option and build the `doc` target.
