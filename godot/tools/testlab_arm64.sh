# Run the Box3D binding selftest on REAL arm64 hardware via Firebase Test Lab.
#
# Why this exists: no arm64 emulator can run on an x86_64 host (Google's
# emulator refuses outright), so the shipped arm64 .so cannot be executed
# locally. Test Lab rents real phones. See godot/ANDROID_BUILD.md.
#
# IMPORTANT: only --device model=<PHYSICAL> proves anything here. Test Lab's
# *virtual* devices are x86 and would exercise the x86_64 .so we already test
# locally -- they would not touch the arm64 library at all.
#
# The APK's main scene is res://tests/test_features.tscn, so the app runs the
# 42 binding assertions on launch, prints "[test] ... -> PASS" to logcat and
# quits. We drive it with a Robo test purely as a launcher and read the logcat.
# Robo may report the run as "failed" because the app exits on its own within
# seconds -- that is expected and irrelevant. The logcat is the result.
#
# Prerequisites (one time):
#   ~/google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud auth login
#   ~/google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
#   Enable Test Lab: https://console.firebase.google.com -> add project
#
# Usage:
#   ./godot/tools/testlab_arm64.sh                 # auto-pick an arm64 device
#   ./godot/tools/testlab_arm64.sh oriole 33       # explicit model + API level
#
#   # Visual run: point it at the demo instead of the harness. Test Lab records
#   # video + screenshots of every run, so this shows the samples actually
#   # rendering on a real phone under Vulkan -- something no emulator here can
#   # show. Video links are printed at the end of the gcloud output.
#   APK=dist/box3d-demo-android.apk ./godot/tools/testlab_arm64.sh
