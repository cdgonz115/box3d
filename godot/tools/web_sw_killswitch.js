// Self-destructing service worker.
//
// The site briefly shipped a threaded build whose PWA service worker cached the
// app and injected COOP/COEP headers. That build could not link on a first
// visit or a hard refresh (shared-memory LinkError), so it was replaced with a
// single-threaded build that uses no service worker at all. But a service
// worker outlives the deploy that shipped it: every browser that visited the
// threaded build still has the old worker registered, still controlling the
// page and still able to serve the broken build from its cache.
//
// This file is deployed AT THE OLD WORKER'S URL (index.service.worker.js). On a
// returning visitor's next navigation the browser's update check fetches it,
// finds new bytes, and swaps it in; it then deletes every cache on the origin,
// unregisters itself, and reloads any open tabs so they load clean from the
// network. First-time visitors never fetch it at all.
//
// Deployed by godot/tools/package_release.sh (copied into the web export), not by the Godot export
// (the export no longer emits a service worker). Harmless to keep deploying
// forever; it only ever runs in browsers that hold the stale registration.
