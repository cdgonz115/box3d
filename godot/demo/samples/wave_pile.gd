## Wave Pile -- a port of upstream's "Determinism / Wave Pile" sample
## (samples/sample_determinism.cpp:112, scene in shared/determinism.c:130-207).
##
## Upstream's Determinism category is the one part of the sample set with no
## Godot analogue, which is awkward for a port whose whole verification story
## leans on determinism. This is that gap closed: 100 convex bodies -- spheres,
## capsules, boxes and rocks, with rolling resistance so the pile settles
## quickly -- dropped onto a wave height field, run until every body is asleep,
## and then CHECKED.
##
## Upstream checks it by hashing the settled transforms and printing the number
## for a human to compare between builds. This port can do better, because the
## binding exposes the recording and replay system (P-045): the world records
## itself from its first tick, and once the pile sleeps the recorded bytes are
## replayed -- at one worker, and then at two, four and eight. Box3D embeds a
## state hash of every body's transform and velocity after each step
## (src/physics_world.c:1173-1180) and the player recomputes and compares them,
## so `has_diverged()` is the verdict. A different worker count re-partitions
## the constraint graph and solves the same island in a different order, so a
## clean replay at 8 workers is a live cross-thread determinism check on the
## property this repo's red lines protect (`-ffp-contract=off`, no `-ffast-math`).
##
## What that does NOT prove, so nobody over-reads a green verdict:
## `b3HashWorldState` covers body transforms and velocities only
## (src/recording.c:1223-1266) -- contacts, joints, impulses and sleep flags are
## not hashed. And the verdict is about THIS build on THIS machine: it says the
## same bytes reproduce the same simulation across worker counts, not that two
## different platforms agree.
##
## Threads are a hard requirement for the multi-worker half. A replay world
## opened with workerCount > 1 builds a scheduler and spawns threads
## (src/scheduler.c), and on a build without pthreads a refused
## thread aborts rather than erroring, so the extra counts are gated on
## `OS.has_feature("threads")` and the single-threaded web build runs the
## one-worker check alone and says so.
##
## Scene constants are upstream's, verbatim:
##  * 21 x 21 grid lines of `b3CreateWave`, scale (1, 0.6, 1), row frequency
##    0.08 along z and column frequency 0.06 along x, no holes
##    (shared/determinism.c:137-138). A height field grows from the body origin
##    along +x / +z, so the body carries upstream's centring offset of half the
##    span (`-0.5 * 1.0 * (21 - 1)` = -10 m on both axes,
##    shared/determinism.c:141-146).
##  * 4 layers of a 5 x 5 grid at 1.7 m spacing, dropped from
##    `2.5 + 1.6 * layer`, each jittered by +/-0.3 m and given a uniformly
##    random orientation (shared/determinism.c:127-128, :165-181).
##  * Sphere r = 0.5, capsule (0,-0.3,0)..(0,0.3,0) r = 0.35, box hull
##    (0.45, 0.3, 0.55) half extents, rock of radius 0.55, cycled by index % 4
##    (shared/determinism.c:152-155, :183-197).
##  * Rolling resistance 0.3 on every shape (shared/determinism.c:161).
##
## The layout is upstream's, not an approximation of it: upstream's random
## number generator is reproduced here -- XorShift32 seeded 52977
## (shared/determinism.c:134, generator at shared/utils.h:27-60) -- and
## `RandomVec3Uniform` and Shoemake's `RandomQuat` draw from it in the same
## order the C does, including upstream's own `b3ComputeCosSin`, which is a
## normalized Bhaskara approximation rather than libm (src/math_functions.c:216-
## 263) and would otherwise put every body at a slightly different angle. The
## arithmetic here runs in GDScript doubles where upstream runs in floats, so
## the scene reproduces to rounding, not bit for bit.
##
## Two GDExtension defaults would have silently changed the scene and are set
## back explicitly: `density` is 1 on the node where `b3DefaultShapeDef` is 1000
## (src/types.c:72-73), and `angular_damping` is 0.05 where `b3DefaultBodyDef`
## is 0. Gravity is upstream's world default of -10 (src/types.c:16), not the
## demo's usual -9.8.

## b3CreateWave's arguments (shared/determinism.c:137-138). The node takes the
## frequencies x-first, so `height_field_wave` is (column, row) = (0.06, 0.08).

## worker threads) and replaying and closing it. Emscripten pre-spawns a fixed
## pthread pool (the "Web Threaded" export sets 16; Godot's own pool takes 4).
## A thread created past the pool gets a Worker that only starts once the main
## thread has returned to the browser event loop, and a pthread_join before
## that never returns: the tab froze at the 8-worker check's close() with the
## old pool of 8. The scheduler never waits on a worker to START (the main
## thread executes pending tasks itself, src/scheduler.c b3SchedulerFinishTask),
## so the only blocking call is the join in close(). Yielding frames here lets
## any late Worker come up first. Native pthreads start synchronously, so 0.
