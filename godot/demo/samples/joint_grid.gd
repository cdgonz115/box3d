## Joint Grid -- a port of upstream's "Benchmark / Joint Grid"
## (samples/sample_benchmark.cpp:206, built by CreateJointGrid in
## shared/benchmarks.c:33). A square lattice of spheres, every one tied to its
## neighbour above and to its left by a SPHERICAL joint, hanging from a static
## top row. Sleeping is off world-wide and on every body, so the whole net is
## awake every step: this measures the solver's joint graph and nothing else.
##
## The spheres are filtered out of colliding with each other (upstream's
## `categoryBits = 2, maskBits = ~2`), so there is not a single contact in the
## scene -- every newton in it comes through a joint.
##
## **Scaled down from upstream.** Upstream runs a 100 x 100 grid: 10,000 bodies
## and 19,800 joints, which is a headless benchmark number, not something the
## sample browser can carry at 60 fps next to a camera and a UI. This ships the
## 32 x 32 grid -- 1,024 bodies and 1,984 joints -- which keeps the lattice
## behaviour and the joint-bound profile at demo cost. The single-threaded
## browser build takes 22 x 22 (484 bodies, 924 joints), the same halving the
## Cube Pile does there. Upstream's own debug configuration uses 10 x 10.
##
## Rendering is one MultiMesh: a thousand separate MeshInstance3Ds would make
## this a draw-call benchmark instead of a solver one.

## Grid lines per side. Upstream: 100 (release) / 10 (BENCHMARK_DEBUG).

## b3ShapeDef.filter: one category, masked out of itself, so no sphere ever
## touches another one -- upstream's `categoryBits = 2, maskBits = ~2u`.
##
## The BIT is deliberately not upstream's 2: layer 2 is the demo shell's
## invisible-guard layer, and the camera's grab ray and its projectiles both
## skip it (`RAY_MASK = 0xFFFFFFFF ^ 2`, common/fly_camera.gd:39). On category 2
## the whole grid was unclickable -- every left-drag grab raycast filtered the
## spheres out before it could hit one. Which bit carries the "don't touch your
## neighbours" rule is arbitrary; not colliding with the shell is not.
