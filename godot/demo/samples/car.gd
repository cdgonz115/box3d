extends Node3D

## Car: a port of box3d's own "Driving" sample (upstream samples/
## sample_joint.cpp), same construction and numbers. The vehicle is pure
## Box3D — nothing pushes the chassis directly, all motion comes from the
## joints and wheel traction:
##   - four sphere wheels hang on Box3DWheelJoints; each joint's suspension
##     spring carries the chassis (hertz 4, damping 0.7, travel ±0.2 m),
##   - the REAR joints drive their spin motor (rear-wheel drive, 5 N·m),
##   - the FRONT joints steer by spring toward target_steering_angle (±45°),
##   - a soft Box3DParallelJoint keeps the chassis upright while letting it
##     pitch/roll with the terrain (and yaw freely to steer),
##   - the ground is a rolling sine-wave triangle mesh (car_terrain.res,
##     baked by tools/gen_car_terrain.gd), standing in for upstream's
##     b3CreateWave height field.
##
## Drive with the ARROW KEYS (or W A S D while not flying the camera):
## Up/Down = throttle, Left/Right = steer. The car crests the swells, leans
## on its suspension, and can be flipped if you fly off a crest badly — the
## upright spring will wrestle it back. The top bar's "Third Person" toggle
## (the shell's reusable sample toggle) glides the shared camera onto a
## chase rig centred on the chassis — hold RIGHT MOUSE there to orbit the
## view around the car (vertical inverted, flight-style; the view STAYS
## where you put it, and W A S D keeps driving while you drag). Toggling
## off glides the free camera back to exactly where you left it.
