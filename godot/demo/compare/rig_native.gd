## Rig (SPEC A) -> live native-physics scene.
##
## The extractor turns an authored Box3D sample into a backend-neutral Rig;
## this turns a Rig into RigidBody3D / StaticBody3D / AnimatableBody3D nodes
## with CollisionShape3D children and Joint3D constraints, so the identical
## scenario can be stepped by GodotPhysics3D or Jolt and put next to Box3D.
##
## FAIRNESS IS THE POINT. Most of this file exists to delete differences that
## are accidents of the API rather than properties of the solver:
##
##   mass       Godot has no density anywhere and no shape-volume API, so mass
##              is integrated here from the shape set (r6 section 4).
##   inertia    GodotPhysics approximates capsule, cylinder, convex-hull and
##              concave inertia from the shape AABB -- its own source says
##              "use bad AABB approximation" -- while Jolt is exact. Both
##              honour an explicit RigidBody3D.inertia plus a custom centre of
##              mass, so every dynamic body gets one, computed analytically.
##   materials  Box3D materials are per shape, Godot's are per body.
##   filtering  Box3D ANDs layer/mask, Godot ORs. Solved for, not copied.
##
## What cannot be removed becomes a warning string. Those are drawn on screen
## beside the run, so they are written for a viewer, not for a log.
##
## Gravity is NOT set here: it lives on the space, not on any node. Call
## apply_world_settings() with the space RID after build().
##
## Everything is static; the builder holds no state between calls.

# --- Tunables ---------------------------------------------------------------

## Godot needs a non-zero report cap before body_entered / body_exited fire at
## all, where Box3D only needs the flag. Small enough not to tax the 64
## contact-monitored pegs in the contacts sample.
const CONTACT_REPORTS := 8

## How many names one warning line spells out before it summarises the rest.
## A 5050-body scenario must not produce a 5050-name string.

## Godot exposes 32 collision layers, which is also the budget for the
## synthesized layer bits below.

## Off-diagonal inertia above this fraction of the trace is called out: Godot
## stores only a diagonal, so such a body's principal axes cannot be matched.

## motion_locks' inert puck (layer 0, mask 0), ragdoll bones (layer 1, mask 1)
## -- are exactly the cases where the two rules disagree.
##
## So the layer set is solved for rather than copied. With layer == mask on
## every body Godot's OR rule collapses to "the two layer sets intersect", and
## reproducing an arbitrary collision matrix under that rule is an edge-clique
## cover: one bit per clique of mutually-colliding filter classes. That is
## exact when it fits, and it cannot express a class that collides with others
## but not with itself, so the result is verified and the failures named.
