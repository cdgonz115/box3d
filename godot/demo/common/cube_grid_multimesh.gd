extends Node3D

## Renders every cube body under this node through ONE MultiMesh.
##
## The Cube Pile is 4096 bodies, and as instanced scenes each carried its own
## MeshInstance3D — 4096 draw calls per frame, which is the dominant rendering
## cost of this sample on mobile (and through the emulator's GL translator).
## A MultiMesh submits all of them as a single draw call; this script frees the
## per-cube meshes at load and copies body transforms into the MultiMesh every
## frame instead. Physics is untouched: same 4096 Box3DBody nodes, and grabbing
## / shooting / raycasts behave exactly as before.
##
## Colors ride along as per-instance MultiMesh colors (continuous pastel hues,
## like the original look) — no materials, no instance-uniform limits.

var _bodies: Array[Box3DBody] = []
## The colour each body was given, kept alongside the MultiMesh rather than only
## in it. The MultiMesh is server-side state: `get_instance_color` reads back
## through the RenderingServer, which stores nothing at all under `--headless`.
## Keeping the array is 16 bytes a cube and is what lets the replay sidecar ask
## (see `get_replay_body_colors` below).

	# build simulates half the pile -- the TOP half is dropped, keeping the
	# footprint and the look while halving solver work. Desktop and Android are
	# untouched, and the on-page banner already tells visitors this build is
	# the preview, not the benchmark. The threaded web build (hosted where real
