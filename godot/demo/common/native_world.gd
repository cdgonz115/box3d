class_name NativeWorld
extends Node3D

## Stand-in for Box3DWorld when a sample is running on Godot Physics or Jolt.
##
## The demo shell is written against Box3DWorld: main.gd looks the world up as
## `get_node_or_null("Box3DWorld")` in seven places, and fly_camera.gd needs
## `add_child`, `global_transform`, `gravity` and `raycast`. This node answers
## all of that, and is DELIBERATELY NAMED "Box3DWorld" by whoever adds it, so
## none of those lookups need to change.
##
## What it deliberately does NOT have is as important as what it does. The
## sidebar shows a row only when `"substep_count" in world` and friends hold
## (main.gd:574-585), so leaving those properties off is what makes the Box3D
## solver controls hide themselves on a native engine. Same for
## `get_step_time_ms`: common/stats_overlay.gd:146 probes for the method and
## drops its solver line when it is missing. Do not add stubs here to "be
## compatible" — a stub would put a dead control back on screen.
##
## Bodies live in the viewport's own World3D space; this node is a container and
## a query facade, not an owner. Per-world gravity has no native equivalent, so
## the setter writes the space's gravity through PhysicsServer3D.

## Which server is actually stepping: "Godot Physics" or "Jolt Physics".

## Gravity is a space parameter natively, not a per-world node property.
## RigExtract.NON_DEFAULT_GRAVITY_SAMPLES of the samples set a non-default
## value (car -10, gyro_torque zero), so this has to be honoured or those
## samples simply run wrong.
## The space's default area is not exposed to script, but both servers'
## area_set_param() accept a SPACE rid and forward it to that space's default
## area, so the space RID is the handle.

## Same signature and return shape as Box3DWorld.raycast, because fly_camera.gd
## consumes both: {"hit": false} or
## {"hit": true, "position", "normal", "fraction", "collider"}.
##
## The mask semantics differ and cannot be fully reconciled: Box3D collides only
## when both sides accept each other, Godot when either does. For a camera pick
## ray that difference is immaterial, and RigNative already rewrites body layers
## so the scene-level filtering matches.
