## Free-fly camera + physics dragging, shared across all samples.
##   Hold RIGHT MOUSE : look around; fly with W A S D and Q / E (Shift = boost)
##   LEFT MOUSE drag  : when not flying, grab a Box3DBody at the point you
##                      clicked and drag that point around (pivots off-center
##                      grabs, e.g. a table's edge, instead of re-centering it)
##   SCROLL wheel     : while holding a body, reel it along the aim ray —
##                      scroll up pushes it away, scroll down pulls it to you
##   F                : hold to charge a shot 0 -> 1 over ~1s, release to fire
##                      (a quick tap still fires a light shot)
##
## The sample browser calls set_world() each time a sample loads, then (if the
## sample's root script exports camera_home / camera_look_at) frame_view() to
## point the camera at that scene's action.
