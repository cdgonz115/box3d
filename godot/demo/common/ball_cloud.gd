extends Node3D

## Every emitter ball in the world, drawn through ONE MultiMesh.
##
## Per-ball MeshInstance3Ds die by draw calls long before the solver hurts:
## the Ball Flood at 12k balls measured 45,000+ draw calls, 21 fps, solver
## 0.00 ms. This is the runtime twin of cube_grid_multimesh.gd -- that one
## adopts a FIXED set of bodies at load, this one grows as emitters spawn
## (capacity doubles when full; MultiMesh.instance_count changes reset the
## buffer, so visible_instance_count draws the live prefix and everything is
## rewritten on the rare grow). Colors ride as per-instance colors; radii as
## a scale baked into each instance basis (the mesh is a unit sphere), which
## also lets balls of different radii share the one mesh.
##
## Emitters opt in per scene (multimesh_render); adopt_into() finds or
## creates the world's shared cloud, so three emitters still mean one draw.
