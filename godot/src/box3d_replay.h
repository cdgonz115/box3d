// Upstream's recording and replay system (box3d.h:255-468), which writes every
// world mutation and every step to a byte stream and can stand that stream back
// up in a fresh world.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. A recording is not a savegame and not an animation: it is a
// determinism instrument. Recording embeds a state hash of the world after
// every step (src/physics_world.c:1173-1180, plus an anchor hash at session
// start, src/recording.c:1062-1066), and replay recomputes that hash and
// compares. Because the player can stand the recording up at a DIFFERENT worker
// count than it was recorded at, and a different worker count re-partitions the
// constraint graph, a replay that reports no divergence is a live cross-thread
// determinism check on the very property this repo's red lines protect
// (box3d.h:322-327).
//
// WHAT IS HASHED, exactly, so nobody over-reads a passing replay:
// b3HashWorldState (src/recording.c:1223-1266) is an FNV-1a over every live
// body's transform (position + quaternion) and, when the body has a solver
// state, its linear and angular velocity. Contacts, joints, impulses and sleep
// flags are NOT hashed. A matching replay proves the bodies ended up in the
// same places at the same speeds; it does not prove the contact set was
// identical along the way.
//
// PATHS. Upstream's b3SaveRecordingToFile / b3LoadRecordingFromFile are plain
// fopen on an OS path (src/recording.c:1113-1177), so they cannot see res://
// (which is inside the .pck of an exported game and is not a file at all) and
// they cannot see user:// on the platforms where it is not a plain directory.
// Neither is bound. Everything here moves bytes through PackedByteArray and
// Godot's own FileAccess instead, which works identically in the editor, in an
// exported desktop game, on Android and in the browser. That is also why the
// player opens from bytes: b3CreatePlayer takes a raw buffer
// (box3d.h:319-324), so no b3Recording ever has to be reconstructed to replay
// one.
//
// The conventional extension is .b3rec (the repo's .gitignore carries it).

// A recording buffer: the write side of the system. Hand one to
// Box3DWorld.start_recording() and it fills as the world steps.
//
// LIFETIME AND THE ONE CONTRACT THAT BITES. The bytes are only a complete,
// loadable recording after the session is stopped: stopping is what appends the
// geometry registry and backpatches the header's registry offset
// (src/recording.c:1069-1108). Reading the bytes mid-session would therefore
// hand out a file that b3CreatePlayer rejects, so get_data() and
// save_to_file() REFUSE while a session is live and say so. Stop first.
//
// A world being destroyed stops its recording for you (b3DestroyWorld ->
// b3StopRecordingInternal, src/physics_world.c:414-415), so a scene that quits
// mid-recording still leaves a complete buffer; Box3DWorld does it explicitly
// so this object's own is_recording() cannot go stale.

	// convention: b3RecMakeBodyId retargets a recorded body id onto the replay
	// world by replacing world0 ONLY, keeping index1 and generation
	// (src/recording_replay.c:656-663), and every replayed b3CreateBody asserts
	// the id it got back has the recorded index1 and generation

	// too. Node paths, names and instance indices survive none of that.

// The read side: an incremental player over recorded bytes, driving its OWN
// private world.
//
// THE PLAYER NEVER TOUCHES YOUR WORLD. b3CreatePlayer stands up a fresh
// b3CreateWorld of its own (src/recording_replay.c:2715-2725, called at :2820)
// and every dispatched op is retargeted onto it — the recorded world id is
// informational and the id-remapping helpers overwrite the world field of every
// body, shape and joint id (src/recording_replay.c:656-681). So replaying
// cannot mutate a Box3DWorld, a Box3DBody or a Box3DJoint that a scene owns,
// however many joint setters the stream contains. That is deliberate here as
// well as upstream: b3RecPlayer_GetWorldId is NOT bound, because handing script
// a raw world id would be the one way to break that guarantee.
//
// ONE PROCESS-WIDE SIDE EFFECT, so budget for it. A recording carries the
// length scale it was made at (src/recording.c:1043) and opening one INSTALLS
// that scale globally (b3SetLengthUnitsPerMeter, src/recording_replay.c:2809-
// 2813), restoring the previous value when the player is closed
// (src/recording_replay.c:2958-2960). While a player is open, every other Box3D
// world in the process is running under the recording's scale. Keep players
// short-lived, and do not open one from a scene that has authored a non-default
// physics/box3d/length_units_per_meter unless the recording was made at the
// same scale. (Upstream leaks the scale when Create fails partway; this binding
// restores it itself on every failure path.)
//
// THREADING. Nothing in the b3RecPlayer_* family is documented thread-safe and
// every call mutates replay state, so drive a player from the main thread only.
// It is unrelated to Box3DWorld's async step: the replay world is a different
// world and is never stepped by the binding's step thread.
//
// NOT BOUND TO SCRIPT, on purpose: b3RecPlayer_GetWorldId,
// b3RecPlayer_DrawFrameQueries and the recorded-query inspection surface
// (GetFrameQuery / GetFrameQueryHit). Handing script a raw world id is the one
// way to break the "the player never touches your world" guarantee above, and
// the query surface is a debug VIEWER's need rather than a determinism
// harness's. b3ValidateReplay is not bound either: it is the one-shot
// assert-based form of the same check, while this player reports divergence as
// data.
//
// b3RecPlayer_SetDebugShapeCallbacks IS wired, but only in C++, and only
// through install_debug_shape_callbacks() below — Box3DReplayRenderer is its
// one caller. Upstream requires it be called immediately after
// b3CreatePlayer, because it destroys and rebuilds the replay world under
// the new callbacks and rewinds to frame 0 (box3d.h:406-413,
// src/recording_replay.c:3635-3671). This class therefore REMEMBERS the
// callback triple and re-applies it inside open(), right after Create, so a
// renderer that was attached before a recording was opened gets the ordering
// upstream asks for without the caller having to sequence it.
