// and is uploaded as one bulk buffer, so scenes with tens of thousands of
// bodies pay no per-node scripting cost to render. This is the C++ successor
// to demo/common/cube_grid_multimesh.gd, built for the Huge Pyramid.
//
// Bodies must share one shape/size (the MultiMesh draws one mesh); the box
// mesh is auto-built from the first body's box_size. Instances are tinted
// with the same continuous pastel hues as the GDScript version.
