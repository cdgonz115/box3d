	// --- Recording (P-045) ---------------------------------------------------
	// Record every mutation of this world, and every step, into the given
	// buffer. See box3d_replay.h for what a recording is for and what its
	// embedded state hashes do and do not cover.
	//
	// ASYNC STEP: recording is SAFE while async_step is on, and is neither
	// refused nor disabled. Traced rather than assumed: upstream writes to the
	// recording from exactly two places inside a step, both on the thread that
	// called b3World_Step (the Step op before the world is locked,
	// src/physics_world.c:1034-1038, and the per-step state hash after it is
	// unlocked, :1173-1180), and every other write comes from an API mutator on
	// the calling thread. Nothing records from a solver worker. The buffer also
	// carries its own mutex (src/recording.h:141), held across each whole
	// record (src/recording.c:698-722). So the only race a binding can create
	// is reading the bytes while the step thread is writing them, and that is
	// closed from the other side: Box3DRecording::get_data() and save_to_file()
	// refuse outright while a session is live, because the bytes are not a
	// loadable recording until stop_recording() has written the registry.
	//
	// start_recording() and stop_recording() themselves must be at a step
	// BOUNDARY: both go through b3GetUnlockedWorldFromId, which B3_ASSERTs on a
	// locked world (src/physics_world.c:96-106, :2300-2320). Both join the async
	// step first, so script cannot trip that.
	//
	// Starting a second session on a buffer that already holds one is REFUSED
	// here rather than silently resetting it: upstream's own guard makes a
	// second b3World_StartRecording on an already-recording world a no-op
	// (src/physics_world.c:2305), while starting on a NEW world would reset the
	// buffer and discard the first session (box3d.h:277-278).
	// --- Contact rules (P-007, engineer-K's table) ---------------------------
	// The rule table driving this world's custom filter, pre-solve, friction
	// and restitution callbacks. Setting it installs it; clearing it or
	// replacing it uninstalls the old one first. A world that is destroyed and
	// recreated reinstalls its rules from ensure_world(), which is the whole
	// reason this is a property rather than a bare rules.install(world) call.

	// --- Contact handles (b3ContactId) ---------------------------------------
	// The contact_began / contact_ended / contact_hit payloads carry a
	// `contact_id`, which is upstream's handle to the contact itself rather than
	// to either shape. It is the only way to follow one contact across steps
	// (types.h:1263-1266): shape ids identify the PAIR, and a pair can lose and
	// remake its contact between steps.
	//
	// The handle is a Vector3i and it is OPAQUE — the components are not
	// coordinates and nothing outside these two methods may read them.
	// b3ContactId is 32 + 16 + 32 bits of payload (id.h:65-71), which does not
	// fit an int; b3StoreContactId packs it into exactly three uint32s
	// (id.h:154-160), so three int32 lanes is the natural carrier. Vector3i is
	// a value type, compares by value and can key a Dictionary, which is what a
	// script tracking contacts over time needs.
	//
	// A handle is transient: Box3D may destroy the contact whenever the world is
	// modified or stepped (types.h:1115-1117). Always ask is_contact_valid()
	// before get_contact_data() — b3Contact_GetData asserts on a stale handle
	// (src/contact.c:62-64 dereferences without checking) rather than returning
	// empty, so the check is not optional. get_contact_data() does it for you.
	//
	// Both are instance methods, not statics, even though b3Contact_IsValid
	// takes no world: they read solver arrays, so they must join an in-flight
	// async step first. Use them on the world that emitted the handle.
